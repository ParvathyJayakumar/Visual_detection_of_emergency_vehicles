# Visual Detection Of Emergency VehicleðŸš¨

This repository implements a **real-time emergency vehicle detection module** using the lightweight and efficient **YOLOv8 Nano** model. Designed for smart traffic systems and autonomous vehicles, it enables rapid detection and response to emergency vehicles in various scenarios.


## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Processes live video feeds or pre-recorded footage.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Optimized for deployment on edge devices with YOLOv8 Nano.
- **High Accuracy:** Detects emergency vehicles with precision in diverse conditions.
- **Easy Integration:** Outputs detection results and supports alert system integration.


## How It Works

1. **Input:** Video frames are processed in real-time.
2. **Detection:** YOLOv8 Nano identifies emergency vehicles with bounding boxes and labels.
3. **Output:** Results are displayed and can trigger alerts.
